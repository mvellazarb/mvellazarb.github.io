In February 2021 I will work 8x50 mins a day, 6 days a week developing my musicianship via self-directed learning.

I have three main aims:
1. to improve my jazz drumming
2. to work towards a 1 hour guitar busking set, and
3. to improve my voice (using exercises given to me by a local teacher.)

I've been inspired by Scott Young to prioritise [doing the real thing](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/05/04/do-the-real-thing/).  With each aim I've therefore defined the real skill I intend to learn, and 'supporting methods' to help me achieve it.

I'm only committing to a month of this as I'm not entirely sure I want to be focusing so heavily on jazz drumming - but I'm curious to find out what it will be like.  Jazz has always been both an interest and a weakness.

## Jazz drumming
**The real thing**
- Playing jazz with musicians, but playalongs (drumless tracks) or playing to records are a close alternative.
- Must learn jazz tunes: learn to sing the melody and play it on the drums, form, kicks/stops.

**Supporting methods**
- Brush technique
- The Art of Bop Drumming
- Tempo training (Metronome on beat 4 of every other bar - alternate 2 bars time, 2 bars Art of Bop comping.)
- Wilcoxon solos
- Listening and transcribing solos/interesting phrases
- Learn the context
    - Singer's perspective: So You Want to Sing Jazz (book)
    - The History of Jazz - Gioia book

## Guitar: To busk for 1 hour
**The real thing**
- Playing songs and singing live.
- Obviously need to practise songs.

**Supporting methods**

## Voice
**The real thing**
- Singing songs live
- Obviously need to practise singing songs.

**Supporting methods**
- 20 min warmup
- Straw singing

## Time allocation 
That's a lot of stuff to do!

I work in units of 50 mins followed by a 10 min break, or 25 mins + a 5 min break.

You can find the time I've allocated to each practice component + a log of my work hours on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BktjzVre4OonX96VQzwDS1oSOpOtzaOjfG9t0cERbws/).

### What didn't make the cut

In allocating time I asked "how directly does this relate to the real thing?"

Due to limited time I chose to leave out "learn the context" (jazz drumming) - I deemed it not relating directly enough.  I've also left out working on composing - both actually composing, as well as learning related theory (Coursera songwriting courses, books on arranging etc.)  Perhaps I'll work on these for leisure if I'm feeling up to it, or formally commit to them after February.
