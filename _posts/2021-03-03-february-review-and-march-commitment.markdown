## February 2021 review

You can find my February 2021 commitment [detailed here.]({% post_url 2021-01-31-february-2021-learning-commitment %})

I worked for a total of 5218 mins - only 56% of my target of 9200 mins (400 mins (8 50 minute sessions) * (28 days - 4 weekend days - 1 day bereavement leave.))

The table below shows the proportion of target minutes I completed, broken down by each practice method and sorted in descending order.

| Method                   | Proportion of target mins done |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 20 min warmup (voice)    |                         91.96% |
| Wilcoxon                 |                         86.96% |
| Song practice (guitar)   |                         82.61% |
| Justin Guitar            |                         81.57% |
| Brushes                  |                         78.26% |
| Art of Bop               |                         74.96% |
| Tempo                    |                         73.91% |
| Straw singing            |                         55.22% |
| Transcription            |                         39.74% |
| Learning & playing tunes |                         36.77% |
| Song practice (voice)    |                         26.09% |

### Voice
20 min warmup done consistently.  This was well-defined and easy to do.  Not sure how much I improved though - will have to take a video and compare with the video I took at the start of February.

Straw singing - Only 55% done.  Well-defined, but frustrating - I barely felt like I was making progress and began to question whether I would be better off doing other exercises.  Is this exercise used to grow the voice or just to warm it up?  A question for my teacher.  I should take a video and compare - perhaps I would be surprised.

Song practice - Only 26% done - the least consistent of all.  Felt embarrassed doing this one others were around.  Also not sure how beneficial it was, but certainly got some interesting insights out of recording myself and comparing with the song.

### Drums
Wilcoxon - Consistent, well-defined, and definitely making progress.  Really enjoy it too.

Brushes - I've made progress, and was fairly consistent, but I really need to start moving on from the exercise I'm practising.  I feel I've plateaued and got stuck on it.

Art of Bop - Making progress, well-defined, enjoyable and really looking forward to finishing this book!  I think it will be so satisfying to finally finish a drum book.

Tempo - Definitely made progress, but not sure how long I should be working on the same set of tempos.  I should experiment with the faster tempos and less frequent clicks.

Transcription - Only 40% done.  Due to noise I need to be careful about scheduling this at the right hour of the day in order to be able to do it.

Learning & playing tunes - Only 37% done, and actually most of that time was spent only listening to jazz music - hardly a direct practice method!  This category was too broad (reflected also by the large amount of time I allotted to it - 2.5 hrs) and I fell into the easiest interpretation of it.  I feel it's important to listen to jazz, but I definitely would have benefited to actually _playing_ it more.  I did do some playing in jam sessions, which were fun and felt very beneficial.  I still have to listen to the recordings of those, and I would count that time as part of this category.  But perhaps therefore this should be split into two categories: listening to jazz, and playing jazz (where this would include also listening back to a recording of my playing.)


### Guitar
Song practice & Justin Guitar - consistent, well-defined, really enjoy it.  Progress is slower than I imagined, but definitely happening.

## March 2021 commitment

In March 2021 I would like to keep up my three aims (working towards a guitar busking set, improving my voice, and jazz drumming.)

I found 8x50min sessions quite overwhelming so this month I'll set out to do 7x50min (6 days a week) instead.

I've split "Learning & playing tunes" into "Listening to jazz" and "Playing jazz" (with others, or to playalongs or records.  Time spent reviewing recordings of my playing will go here too.)

You can find the time I've allocated to each practice component + a log of my work hours on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrJxEyP9rXAedgrsKJtMCz5OKElwtTJN3NmG8kpM2ds/)
